# social-network-api

## Description

I was tasked to create a social network API using mongoDB, mongoose and express.js

I was motivated to undertake this task because I wished to gain a greater understanding of how to create APIs and use a non-relational database (MongoDB with mongoose).
## Solve

The completion of this project provides the user with a social network API. This API contains functionality to find, create, update and delete users, friends, thoughts, and reactions.

## Installation

Steps to install this project on your local PC

1. Open the termal on your machine.
2. Use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where you want the repository located.
3. Locate the 'Code' button on the 'social-network-api' github repository, click it, then copy the 'HTTPS' link to clipboard. (See image)

4. Use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to your machine.
5. The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. Navigate into your new directory using `cd`.
6. The repository should now be cloned onto your device and able to be edited in VScode or another editing software.
